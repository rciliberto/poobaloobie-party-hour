## v0.00.002 - Text rendering, image manipulation, hash tables

Renderer:
	- Pass 8-bit integers "type" and "sampler_index" to shader
		- Sample texture differently depending on "type" (text or regular quad)
		- Sample with nearest/linear min/mag depending on sampler_index
		- Set min/mag filtering in Draw_Quad
		- Images are now created and deleted directly with gfx calls rather than deferring it for gfx_update.
		- We can now set image sub data with gfx_set_image_data()
		- Images are no longer hard coded to 4 channels
		
Text/Fonts:
	- Added font loading with lazy initialization/rasterization when it's needed
		- Load & rasterize any fonts with load_font_from_disk()
		- Fonts automatically rasterize glyphs into atlases and generate metrics on the fly
		- Measure text for very_useful metrics with measure_text()
		- Walk over glyphs and their metrics with walk_glyphs()
	- Implemented simple but powerful text rendering
		- Draw text with draw_text() or draw_text_xform()
	- See oogabooga/examples/text_rendering.c for more
			
Other:
	- Added 3 simple hash functions:
		- 64-bit xx_hash(): Very fast hash for 64-bit values
		- 64-bit city_hash(): Very fast hash for short strings
		- 64-bit djb2_hash(): Fast hash for strings longer than 32 bytes
		- Made a generic get_hash() macro to detect the type you are trying to hash and call the approriate procedure
	- Introduced a simple (kinda slow) hash table with following procedures:
		- hash_table_add
		- hash_table_find
		- hash_table_contains
		- hash_table_set
		See hash_table.c for more information.
	- Utf8 utility:
		- utf8_to_utf32(): convert utf8 bytes to a single u32 codepoint
		- next_utf8(): Convert first utf8 character in a string to a u32 codepoint and advance the passed string to the next unicode
	- Renamed m4_multiply -> m4_mul for consistency
	- Refactored os window to be DPI aware
		- Window now has scaled_width, scaled_height which is the DPI-scaled size. Previous window.width & window.height are now aliased as window.pixel_height and window.pixel_width for clarity
	- in minimal example, renamed hammer_xform -> rect_xform
